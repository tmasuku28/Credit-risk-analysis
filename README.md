Credit Risk analysis for extending bank loans

#Overview
This project focuses on analyzing credit risk for bank loans using binomial regression models implemented in R. The aim is to assess the probability of default for loan applicants based on various features and historical data.

#Purpose
The primary goal of this project is to provide insights into credit risk assessment methodologies for loan approvals. By employing binomial regression models in R, the project evaluates the probability of default, aiding in informed decision-making for loan applications.

#Technologies Used
R: The project extensively utilizes R programming language for data analysis and model development.
Binomial Regression Models: Implemented to predict the likelihood of default based on historical data and applicant features.
Data Processing and Analysis: Various R libraries such as caret and glm.

#Contents
Data: Includes datasets used for training and testing the model.
Scripts: R scripts containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.
Results: Summary of model performance, insights derived, and visualizations depicting the analysis.

#Usage
Data Preparation: Instructions for obtaining and preparing the dataset for analysis.
